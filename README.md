# Suicide-Rate-Analysis-in-India-Using-Data-Analytics-and-Power-BI
This project focuses on analyzing suicide rates in India using data analytics techniques and interactive visualizations with Power BI. By leveraging data-driven insights, the study aims to identify key patterns, trends, and factors influencing suicide rates across different regions, age groups, and demographics.

#Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze suicide rates in India using data analytics and visualization tools like Power BI to identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors. By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, the study aims to:
1)Raise awareness about suicide as a critical public health issue.
2)Support policymakers, researchers, and mental health advocates in creating targeted interventions.
3)Enable informed decision-making to reduce suicide rates and improve mental health support systems across India.


#Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes publicly available records related to suicide rates in India. It contains information on:
1)Age Groups: Analysis by various age categories.
2)Gender: Trends in male and female suicide rates.
3)States: Region-wise data for state-specific analysis.
4)Years: Year-over-year trends and patterns.

#Requirements
To replicate this project, you'll need:
1)Python (for initial data preparation and preprocessing).
2)Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
3)Power BI Desktop (to build and explore dashboards).

#How to Use
1)Clone the repository to your local system.
2)Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the dataset and perform analysis.
3)Load the processed dataset into Power BI to explore the interactive dashboard.
4)Review the insights and observations for research or presentation purposes.

#Acknowledgments
This project is adapted from a previous GitHub repository that focused on analyzing suicide rates in India. It has been used solely for practice purposes to enhance my skills in data analytics and visualization. Additionally, Power BI was incorporated into the project for more interactive learning and to explore dynamic dashboard creation. Special thanks to the original contributors of the GitHub project for providing a solid foundation for this analysis. This adaptation aims to deepen understanding and provide insights through hands-on practice.
